Free Room Finder
================


Tired of Rooms on Campus Always Being in Use?
---------------------------------------------

We feel your pain, the Free Room Finder is here to solve that by finding free
rooms on campus during the time or duration you need a room and given the date
you need a free room.


What the Free Room Finder Does Well
-----------------------------------

Find all free rooms on campus according to a detailed internal list of every course
at UOIT/DC and by finding free time slots for rooms by determining times when
they are not being used for any classes.


What the Free Room Finder Doesn't Do Well
-----------------------------------------

+ Detect students who may have already found the free room before you and are using it
*(Don't panic we've got this one solved! We need help setting up a wireless sensor network
to detect students in rooms, see below)*
+ Detect clubs and other organizations who may have booked the room through other school
organizations such as the SA, Campus Societies, or the mob.


How You Can Contribute
----------------------

While the database, data collection scripts for getting all courses on campus, and the scripts
for analyzing the data to find free rooms are all complete there is still much to be done, such
as:

+ A web interface for searching for free rooms and viewing the results in a browser
+ Detecting students who may have already found the free room before you and are using it, 
a wireless sensor network to detect students in rooms would be an excellent solution
+ An effective solution to determine clubs and other organizations who may have booked the room 
through other school organizations such as the SA
+ Code refactoring and documentation, we are leaning towards [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/)
or [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/), but even a wiki would be great
