REDESIGN CHANGES
================


offerings
----------

- campusId attribute was missing, I added it

    campusId    INTEGER UNSIGNED       NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY(campusId) REFERENCES campus(campusId)
        ON DELETE CASCADE    ON UPDATE CASCADE);

- Go over offerings, there are a number of values that set as just UNSIGNED, not
  sure if they should be set to NOT NULL as well

- profId and roomId CANNOT BE SET TO "NOT NULL" since the foreign keys are set 
  to "ON DELETE SET NULL"


- NOT SURE IF FOREIGN KEY(finish_time) REFERENCES times(time) SHOULD REFERENCE
  "time" attribute since timeId is the PRIMARY KEY of times table

- NOT SURE IF FOREIGN KEY(end_date) REFERENCES dates(date) SHOULD REFERENCE
  "date" attribute since dateId is the PRIMARY KEY of dates table

- Go over offerings thoroughly I made a lot of changes to it

- Renamed foriegn key classId to typeId as it was being used as foreign key but
  didn't exist should there be a typedId AND classId in the table???



rooms
------

- Should power outlets and ethernet ports have boolean as default TRUE, since
most of the rooms have it


times/dates
------------

- Added a UNIQUE constraint since you said they are distinct values
